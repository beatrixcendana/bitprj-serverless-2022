## About Me
<aside>
ðŸ’™ Hi, I am Beatrix Cendana. I am a student, designer, and writer with background in math and medical. My passion is to combine design thinking with writing and coding. Thatâ€™s why I ended up being a tech writer in BitProject. 

Even though my coding skill isnâ€™t that great, I believe that I can impact others with my basic skills. As proof, I was also one of the students in BitProject Serverless Camp last year, and I completed the camp until week 8, which was building the final project. I created Food Reminder SMS to help users generate the recipe and get a reminder to have meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). I was so lucky that my project got chosen to present at the tech conference. It was my first tech talk in front of tech professionals.

Last but not least, nice to meet you all, and I am looking forward to working with all BitProject members again and the camp students!
